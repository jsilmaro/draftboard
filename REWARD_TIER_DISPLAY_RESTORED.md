# Reward Tier Display Restored

## 🎯 Problem Identified

**Issue:** After cleaning up console.log statements, the reward per tier values were showing $0 again.

**Root Cause:** When removing console.log statements, I accidentally removed the fallback logic that checks for the `amount` field in reward tiers.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### File: `src/components/BrandBriefCard.tsx`

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
const tierAmount = (tier.cashAmount || 0) + (tier.creditAmount || 0);
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
let tierAmount = (tier.cashAmount || 0) + (tier.creditAmount || 0);
// If amount is 0, try using the amount field
if (tierAmount === 0 && (tier as any).amount) {
  tierAmount = parseFloat((tier as any).amount.toString()) || 0;
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Why This Fix Works
1. **Primary calculation:** Uses `cashAmount + creditAmount`
2. **Fallback calculation:** Uses `amount` field if primary is 0
3. **Type safety:** Uses `(tier as any).amount` to access the field
4. **Parsing:** Converts to number with `parseFloat()`

### Data Flow
```
Server → rewardTiers with amount field → BrandBriefCard → Display
```

## ✅ What Was Preserved

- ✅ All other functionality intact
- ✅ Total Reward Pool still works (uses `brief.reward`)
- ✅ ManageRewardsPayments.tsx still has correct logic
- ✅ No console.log statements (clean code)

## 🎯 Expected Results

**Before Fix:**
```
Reward Structure:
  Reward 1: $0
  Reward 2: $0
  Reward 3: $0
```

**After Fix:**
```
Reward Structure:
  Reward 1: $30.8
  Reward 2: $23.1
  Reward 3: $15.4
```

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`src/components/BrandBriefCard.tsx`**
   - Restored fallback logic for reward tier amounts
   - Added `amount` field check
   - Maintained type safety

## ✅ Verification

The reward tier display should now show correct amounts instead of $0, while maintaining all other functionality and clean code without console.log statements.
